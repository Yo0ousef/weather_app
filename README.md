# weather_app

A Flutter application designed to display real-time weather conditions for any country the user searches.

The application's theme dynamically changes to reflect the current weather.
For instance, if the weather is sunny, the interface will adopt a bright, cheerful yellow theme. 
Conversely, if it's raining, the theme will shift to a soothing blue to mimic the rainy atmosphere.
